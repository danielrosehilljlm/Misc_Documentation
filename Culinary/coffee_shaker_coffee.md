# You've been drinking coffee wrong all these years!

(Please do not take this post too seriously)

If you're a Github user, or into technology at all, then there's a very high chance that you are egregiously addicted to caffeine.

Double-blinded placebo-controlled study at reputable reserach institutes have shown this to be undeniably true.

But how I know that about YOU you might be wondering? 

I simply do. And this isn't the time or place to question the premise of this article.

As a long-term caffeine abuser you probably think that you know or two about coffee. 

You may even own one of those fancy AeroPress contraptions or perhaps a handheld device like the Wacaco Minipresso. 

Or perhaps you think like I did about a year ago that my method of drinking coffee — via an automatic Turkish coffee maker — was better than what most people were consuming.

**But have you ever stopped to wonder what faulty premises might be underlying the totality of your coffee knowledge?**

Did you ever think that maybe you should be **EATING** your coffee!?

Ah, chocolate-covered coffee beans, I've heard of those - you might be thinking. Not so far. There is a better way. A new way. And it's called:

## Cocktail Shaker Coffee

Let me explain the rationale first. Because if you're going to be putting your cholestrol level on the line then you probably want to know why you are thinking about doing so.

Brewed coffee is, in chemical terms, clealy an extraction: a water-based extraction. However you make it — the hot water draws the caffeine and the other psychoactive xanthines out of the bean.

You've probably believed that water must be an efficient extraction medium. I mean why else would we drink coffee this way? But here you would be WRONG!

Browsing Quora one night I chanced upon a discovery. A mind-blowing discovery. A HISTORICAL discovery.

[You can read it for yourself here](https://www.quora.com/How-much-caffeine-remains-in-used-coffee-grounds/answer/Peter-Baskerville)

In the course of four short paragraphs, Mr. Baskerville — who puts the number of coffee cups he has brewed in the six figure range — highlights that SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH has demonstrated that **MOST CAFFEINE IS LEFT IN THE COFFEE BEAN AFTER BREWING**.

But wait, there's more.

You might know that there are two common variants of the coffee bean: Arabica and Robusta. And the research even tells us how efficiently either is extracted.

Intrigued by the numbers in the [research with Baskerville was citing](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf3040594) I decided to dig a little deeper.

And when I set the power of LIBRE OFFICE CALC upon those figures here's what I found out:

You read that right — **52% of the caffeine that coffee has to offer remains trapped in the bean after conventional brewing!**.

Something had to be done. And so I devised a method.

## Equipment Required

- Fine coffee. Turkish is best. And it should ideally be less than 200 microns in diameter. You can find measuring sieves for acquariums on eBay if you're sufficiently interested. If you don't live near a Turkish or Middle Eastern bazaar then get your hands on some espresso — the finest grind you can find.
- A cocktail shaker. Any will do.
- Tap water
- Desperation

## Method

This is very important. If you're going to be shooting back the whole coffee mixed into water — which is a solution and not an extraction — you will be ingesting DOUBLE the caffeine.

Caffeine overdose is a real possibility here so use HALF the coffee that you usually would. Ie, if you usually use two tablespoons to make a double espresso then use only one.

Next, add your coffee and water to the shaker. Remember: the more water you add, the more raw coffee water you’re going to have to drink!

Next, you’re going to have to shake the ‘cocktail’ vigorously. Do not skimp on this step. You’ll be glad you did when it’s time to drink the concoction!

Your beautiful coffee-water is now ready for consumption.

Just compare the before and after pictures to see how more drinkable it’s looking.

And you can use a small handheld electric blender instead of a cocktail shaker.

Here are some extra benefits of drinking coffee the smart way:
- More efficient.  You’ll only go through half the coffee of your unenlightened friends/coworkers for the same amount of caffeine!
- Electricity free . No more kettles and boiling water! Drink your coffee- water wherever you can take out a cocktail shaker!
- Lightning-quick . Have your coffee drunk in about 30 seconds from start to finish. Unbeatable!
- Added fiber! You won’t only be mopping up every miligram of coffee in the bean — you’ll be getting added fiber and nutrients too!

Happy coffee-water drinking!
